## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later.
- **JDK**: 17 or higher (for optimal Compose support).
- **Android SDK**: Target API 34+, minimum API 24.
- **Emulator/Device**: Pixel 6+ emulator or physical device with developer options enabled.

### Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakashkailashiya/AiDev.git
   cd AiDev
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   - Import the project and let Gradle sync (it uses Kotlin DSL for cleaner builds).
   - Review `libs.versions.toml` for version management of Compose, Hilt, and other libs.

3. **Build & Run**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleDebug  # For debug APK
   ```
   - Connect your device or start an emulator (API 24+).
   - Hit **Run** (Shift + F10) and grant permissions as prompted (e.g., for sensors, location, and storage).

### APK Download
For quick testing without building:
- Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aakashkailashiya/AiDev/releases).
- Install via `adb install app-debug.apk` or sideload directly.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1. **Launch & Navigate**:
   - Open the app to land on the intuitive dashboard.
   - Use the bottom navigation bar for core sections: **Info**, **Sensors**, **Network**, **Apps**, **Tools**, **Productivity**.

2. **Permissions**:
   - The app requests runtime permissions for accurate data (e.g., `READ_PHONE_STATE` for network, `BODY_SENSORS` for health metrics).
   - Check **Settings > Permissions** in-app for granular control.

3. **Pro Tips**:
   - Enable dark mode via system settings for the best Material 3 experience.
   - Use the search bar in explorers to filter sensors or apps quickly.
   - Export logs/reports as JSON/CSV for external analysis.
